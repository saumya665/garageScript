Vim: Vim is a text editor, available in every unix machine. It can open every file on your computer, including mp3s, pngs, etc etc.
Unlike other text editors, you can’t code on it right away. You must think about what you want to do first, then write. Think twice, code once. 
There are 2 important modes:
normal: Place for you to think about what you want to do. You will be spending 90% of your time in this mode.
insert: edit and make modifications.
To open a file, type vim path/to/file
If file doesn’t exist, a new one will be created for you when you save
Common commands in normal mode:
hjkl: these four keys are used as navigation keys to h-left j-up k-down and l-right, to move around the editor.
Going into insert mode:
o/O creates a new line below/above your cursor and puts you into insert mode
s deletes what is under the cursor and puts that place in the insert mode.
i/I allows you to insert the text at the cursor point/start of line.
a/A allows you to insert the text after the cursor point/end of line
D is used to cut the text in the editor line where the cursor is present.
P is used to paste the text which is cut by using the D command.
<number>command: Do command <number> times
5p - paste 5 times
:w to save the vim file.
:q to quit the vim editor.
:q! This vim command is like a force
